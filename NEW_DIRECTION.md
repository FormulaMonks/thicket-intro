New Direction
=============

Our current microsite is _fine_, but it's not great. We want to make something great; something that really pulls people in.

The basic guiding principle: ditch the space thing. It's cute, and it works well in a half-hour talk, but it doesn't provide enough of a real-world hook to pique interest within the first glance at a website.


Ideas
=====

There are a lot of possible ways to tell the story of the distributed web and Thicket. Let's think through a few.


Who Controls The Information?
-----------------------------

Open with that question. "Who controls the information?"

Then show a graph, perhaps, or a timeline, showing how many entities have decided what information to show people over time. It goes from a very small number before the internet, to a growing number up through the early 00s, and then a decreasing number. [CAVEAT: I have no idea if these data already exist, and would not want to create a realistic looking graph based only on conjecture. We would need to find some way to quantify this, or otherwise scrap the idea altogether and go with some less-quantifiable way of telling the story.]

The story is that a very few oligarchs decide, through algorithms driving ad revenue, what information to show us. We do not own our information or have a say in the algorithms that shape our society. But Citrusbyte is working on ways to change that.

This idea is largely inspired by this article: [The internet has been stolen from you. Take it back, nonviolently.](https://medium.com/@flyingzumwalt/the-internet-has-been-stolen-from-you-take-it-back-nonviolently-248f8d445b87)


You don't control your data
---------------------------

Similar to the first idea, but avoids asking a question that begs to be backed up with data that we don't have.


The Internet is Broken
----------------------

This idea is largely inspired by [Blockstack's announcement post](https://blockstack.org/blog/introducing-the-blockstack-browser-a-gateway-to-a-new-decentralized-internet) and [Malcolm Gladwell's thoughts on the Internet](https://www.vox.com/conversations/2016/10/6/12291018/malcolm-gladwell-ezra-klein#HhFlqa)

I really love the way Blockstack present it:

> Imagine a world where people don't have property rights. In this world, you cannot own a house, and all your belongings are kept in a storage facility owned by a few corporations. And in this world, walking into any store or theater implies that you disclose all your personal information, places you've been, other things you've bought to the business owners. You are tracked 24/7, your belongings are stolen from storage facilities, and you can't do anything about it.
> 
> Most of us would not stand for this in our real, everyday lives. But on the internet, we tolerate and even expect it. We become dependent on nameless, faceless, remote parties just by connecting. On the internet, we are powerless. Our existence on the internet is defined by others, whether that other be a mega-corporation or a government.
> 
> Now, we can change that.

I'm not sure how, but maybe we could do our own take on this sort of an idea.


Which for-profit algorithm told you how to feel today?
------------------------------------------------------

Focus specifically on the fact that nearly all of our information and relationships are mediated by the algorithms of Facebook and Google.


Your friendships are worth $12 per year
---------------------------------------

As of 2016, the amount of money that Facebook made per-user per-year was about $12. We could frame our story around the monetization of our relationships, and how Thicket is an app that resists the commoditization of relationships.
